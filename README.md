Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

~Software engineering is the development , design and maintenance of software applications and systems.

.It is important to technology in a myriad of ways namely:
.Innovation-through its organised approach developers can sync their different abilities and drive innovation.
.Helps ensure quality design and development of applications.
.Helps reduce losses caused oftenly by errors in systems.
.It promotes collaboration among developers helping match software development with business plans.





Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

~The Birth of programming-started in the early 1960s with clear structured programming involving iterations rather than the current arbitrary shortcuts.
.Paved way for enhanced code quality and also greatly helped layout structure forcurrent programming languages.

~Introduction of flexible methodologies- started in 2001 it saw introduction of collaborations more involvement with developers and interactions.
. Adaptability- helped developers cope easily with ever changing tech space.
. Collaboration- allowed for better alignment with user requirements and needs.

~Rise of DevOps-saw the collaboration of developers and operations to enhance software quality and maintenances.
.Helped faster development of softwares.
.Helped create more sustainable systems and improved user experiences.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

•Planning-identifying stakeholders and determining the viability and feasibility of the software.
•Requirements gathering and analysis -relevant tools and data are identified and collected involving all parties.
•Quick design - a prototype of the main software is built.
•Build prototype -actual coding takes place to create the working model.
•Testing- the software is analysed for defects if present and accordingly corrected.
•User evaluation- the software is deployed to the users to determine if it meets their needs.
•Maintenance-the software is analysed for bugs and errors to ensure functionality.
•Evaluation-feedback is collected from the users to determine software efficiency.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

•Similarities°
-Both aim to develop and output high quality software.
-Both follow a sequential and structured process to develop software.
-Both employ requirement gathering before before building software.
-Both employ use of testing software methods before deployment

•Contrast°
-Waterfall methods is done in phases and sequence while agile is incremental and iterative in nature.
-Waterfall methods has an already established plan while in agile the planning process is continuous.
-In waterfall the software is released once while in agule the releases are frequent in nature.
-In agile there is active and constant user involvement while in waterfall there is less user involvement in the development process.
•Agile iused in cases where;
-The timeframe for developing is shorter
-The requirements and tools for design are ever changing.
-There is need for high user involvement.
•Waterfall is usedd where:
-The software is small and stable and there is no need for changing
-The timeframe for development is longer.
-There is less need for frequent updates and a clear scopefor development is in place.




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

•Software developers
-Write the actual code and run it to create softwares and applications.
-Design softwares to ensure they are easy to use.
-Check the system for errors and debugg to ensure efficiency.
-Collaborate with other developers to ensure softwares align with business needs 
-Test the software for defects and correct them to ensure they work properly.

•Quality assurance
-Test the planning methods to ensure feasibility based on requirements.
-Test software design to ensure it meets the expected user needs.
-Perfom manual and automated tests on the software to ensure efficiency.
-Track for defects in the software abd act accordingly.

•Project Managers
-Coordinate the various software teams to ensure teamwork in yhe development process.
-Manage the budget in place for the development process.
-Manage risks that may disrupt the process and ensure smooth workflow for the project 



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

•Integrated development environments
~They are very useful by:
-Allowing code editing and syntax rnabling faster development e.g Visual studio code.
-Version control integration allowin developers to make easy changes eg Git
-Allowing for debbuging to ensure efficient softwares through softwares like InteliJ
-Enabling user interface designs hence faster and efficient front end development ag X code.
•Version control systems are essential in:
-Recovery of software and back up to ensure codes are securely stored eg Git 
-Collaboration as developers can easily work together to help develop better systems through Github
-Change tracking so developers can easily note changes in the code via platforms such as Git Lab
-Code Quality control allowing changes to be made and reviewed wg VSCODE.





What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

•Dynamic and ever growing tech space makes it had for developers to always cope with changes.
•Time deadlines caused by the multiple tasks and intensive development exercise.
•Errors and bugs that frustrate the developers and consume alot of time.
•Integrating various third party softwares during developer may not work due to incompatibility.
•Security threats to the code from system intruders.

~Solutions include :
•Constant learning for developers through tech events and forums to stay up to date with emerging yrends in technology.
. Prioritizing tasks based on their importance through tools such as MosCow and timing and creating buffer times for unexpected changes.
.Conducting regular security audits and check ups to spot attacks.
. Performing extensive research on third party softwares and understanding their terms and conditions of operations.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

•Unit testing- inolves testing individual compinents of the software.
-Helps detect issues early hence immediate correction and enable trusted code refractoring to the developer.

•Integration testing- it's the testing of interactions between connected components of the system.
-Helps detect issues associated with interactions within the software early
-Helps ensure different interfaces work together efficiently within the system.

•Function testing -ensures that the various software functionalities work as per user needs.
-Helps the user determine the software meeets his needs and requirements.

•System testing- tests the whole software to ensure it properly functions as a whole.
-Ensures the system meets the user needs before deployment and the whole application is functioning as a whole.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting and designing queries for AI models to ensure it outputs the desired response.

•It is important as it:
_ Enhances accuracy in its output since the output most likely meets the users needs.
-Helps in innovation as it provides relevant information and ideas in the various fields.
-Facilitates the easy performing of tasks considered to be complex 
-Gives the user more control over the AI models to ensure it most aligns with their needs.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt- 'Tell me about dogs'
Improved prompt- 'Provide me a general overview of dogs, their characteristics, different breeds and why they are best suited as pets.'
-The improved prompt gives the user intensive and extensive information on dogs allowing him to compare and contrast diversely since the response is clearly specified and the user is able to make a decision confidently based on comprehensive information.
